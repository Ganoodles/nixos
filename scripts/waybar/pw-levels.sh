#
# A script to display the pipewire/wireplumber volume in Waybar
# 
# This is an optimised bash script. wpctl is called once every $DELAY seconds 
# to obtain the default sink volume. No other process is started. 
#
# The waybar configuration should look like that 
# 
# "custom/pipewire": {
#    "tooltip": false,
#    "max-length": 6,
#    "restart-interval": 10,
#    "exec": "exec $HOME/path-to/pw-volume-monitor.bash"
# },
#

# The script is not properly terminated when waybar is restarted.
# This is probably because it is started via '/bin/sh -c "..."' and
# /bin/sh does not always terminate its children processes when it dies.

# A trick is to declare the waybar custom module with
#     "exec": "exec path-to-this-script"
# The second 'exec' is the builtin command that tells /bin/sh to terminate
# and replace itself by the script. Consequently, waybar will send the
# termination signal directly to the script.
# That trick also save a bit of resources (one less process in the background)
#

# Another simple trick is to make the shell script terminate as soon as
# a command fails. In that case, that the 'echo' commands will fail 
# when STDOUT ceases to be valid.
# Anyway, this is always a good idea to stop a script when something
# goes wrong (e.g. wpctl or pipewire not working as expected)
